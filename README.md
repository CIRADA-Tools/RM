 Python scripts to perform RM-synthesis, RM-clean and QU-fitting on
 polarised radio spectra.


 Initial version by Cormac R. Purcell
 Currently maintained by CIRADA


Structure:  
RMtools_1D  ... 1D utilities to analyse Faraday spectra of single pixels.  
RMtools_3D  ... 1D utilities to analyse Faraday spectral cubes.  
RM-tools can be installed by downloading the source code, unzipping, and running the following command from inside the RM directory:
pip install .

This will make the following modules importable in Python:

RMtools_1D  ... 1D utilities to analyse Faraday spectra of single pixels.
RMtools_3D  ... 1D utilities to analyse Faraday spectral cubes.
RMutils     ... Core functions used by the analysis utilities.

Instructions for running the various routines can be found in the 1D/ and 3D/ directories. Further details will be added to the [wiki](https://github.com/CIRADA-Tools/RM/wiki) in due course.

Questions, bug reports, and feature requests can be posted to the GitHub issues page or sent to Cameron Van Eck, cameron.van.eck (at) dunlap.utoronto.ca.

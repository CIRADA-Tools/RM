        Structure:  
        RMtools_1D  ... 1D utilities to analyse Faraday spectra of single pixels.  
        RMtools_3D  ... 1D utilities to analyse Faraday spectral cubes.  
        
        This will make the following modules importable in Python:
        
        RMtools_1D  ... 1D utilities to analyse Faraday spectra of single pixels.
        RMtools_3D  ... 1D utilities to analyse Faraday spectral cubes.
        RMutils     ... Core functions used by the analysis utilities.
